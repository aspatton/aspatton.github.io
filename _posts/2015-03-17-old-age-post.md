Facebook CEO told an audience in 2007 "Young people are just smarter". While he hasn't met the young people around me, his attitude is the norm in the tech industry - at least, the companies on hot new technology. I never paid much attention to this glaring fact until the odometer hit 45 as I was strolling around San Francisco.

San Francisco is an electric city, expecially related to technology. There is new products and technology in use everywhere and the city is full of hot startups building the next big thing. As I sipped a cold-pressed juice on Market Street, I leafed (virtually) leafed through job postings. They were all using the latest technologies (Node.js, Git, Go, Ruby on Rails, etc.) and I felt right at home until it suddenly dawned on me that I was too old to participate.

Close your eyes and imagine that cool tech startup - do you see any old people? What about just plain older people? Do you see any older workers in all of those want ads? Tech commercials? Attend a hackathon session and see how many older folks show. Go find an older person and ask them about Vine, Meerkat, Snapchat, WhatsApp and on and on. Sure, they know about Facebook and Twitter, but do they keep up with the latest and greatest? Do they even need to?

When I returned to my Midwestern home, I surveyed the local IT landscape. It was chocked full of "my" generation, but then I could not find a lot of young people - WTF? Or should I say OMG? Then I remembered what I did when I was so-called young, I worked in New York, Boston and even San Francisco. I was on the cutting edge of this thing called the World Wide Web - I laughed at all of the folks in my hometown doing COBOL, Visual Basic and C programming.

While I no longer work in the cool cities, I still do pride myself on staying on the cutting edge. I understand everything is mobile these days and everybody has short attention spans. I don't tell "In my days..." stories quite yet. I an knee deep in Node and I live in the cloud, but is there any way I can work on the cool stuff with the up-and-coming companies? Based on want ads and conversations, I say no - sure, I can find work in corporate America or even write about technology but no way I'm welcome in the startup world. Do I make my own startup and hire old people? Does it even matter?

While computers have been around a long, long time, the IT industry is relatively young. The next few years or decade will be interesting as a large number of IT works leave the ranks of youngsters and hipsters and advance in years. Will they change the industry or will they move to the midwest? Will companies like Google be able to survive without older workers?
