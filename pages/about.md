I am a seasoned IT professional with a wide range of technical skills and experience as well as excellent communication skills. Perseverance is one of my strengths when it comes to guiding a project from start to finish as well as resolving issues in a timely manner.

I have worn many hats in my career - developer, editor, analyst, consultant, technical lead, project manager, writer and trainer as well as the opportunity to manage various teams. I have been able to work in many industries through a consulting role as well as getting valuable corporate experience in various Fortune 500 companies. While my education has crucial to my career advancement, actual experience has proved invaluable.

My passion is delivering quality results albeit in the form of a written piece, application development, providing technical leadership or more - customer satisfaction is key.

If I cannot help, chances are I can connect you with somebody who can meet your needs.  

Specialties: technical leadership, communications, creative problem solving and application development.
